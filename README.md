Automatic environmental sound classification (ESC) based on ESC-50 dataset (and ESC-10 subset) built by Karol Piczak and described in the following article: <br>
<b><i> "ESC: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification." </i></b> by Karol J. Piczak. 2015. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia (MM '15). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 1015â€“1018. https://doi.org/10.1145/2733373.2806390"

 Multi-feature Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) achieves accuracy close to <b>99%</b>, with custom pre-processing and a fusion mel-spectrograms + complex wavelet transforms.    <br>
The last confusion "sea waves" "rain" is solved by developping an original transform of the complex CWT.  This Transform, <i> aT-CWT </i> replaces the phase of the CWT for stationary, pseudo-stationary sounds with a Gaussian characteristics.  <br> With the <i> aT-CWT </i> transform, <b><i> the multi-feature CNN model achieves 100% accuracy. </i></b>

In this project we develop effective methods for classifying mitochondrial genomes (DNA sequences) based on Digital Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning. This is on-going research and results will be published on a regular basis. As a starting point we analyzed the following paper: <br>
 <i><b> "ML-DSP: Machine Learning with Digital Signal Processing for ultrafast, accurate, and scalable genome classification at all taxonomic levels" </b></i> by Gurjit S. Randhawa , Kathleen A. Hill and Lila Kari. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5571-y
<br><br>
Their alignement free DNA sequence classification approach: ML-DSP is very effective.
By introducing a simple alignment technique and short FFTs:  ML-FFT + SoftAlign, we outperform ML-DSP with difficult datasets: Fungi, Insects. </ul></ul>

Modeling is the process that formalizes a concrete problem in mathematical terms accessible to analysis and numerical calculation.

Scientific computing is the interdisciplinary field that brings together the methods and algorithms for performing, using computers, numerical simulations based on a scientific approach. Most models involve equations (differential or partial derivatives) too complicated to be solved by elementary methods or using computer algebra techniques. Scientific computing proposes to give approximate numerical solutions to these models. The development of scientific computing is linked to the regular increase in the power of computers. It is therefore a constantly evolving sector.

Companies that use and develop modeling and scientific computing range from large state-owned or private companies responsible for designing and developing complex systems to small companies or start-ups specializing in software development. They operate in all sectors of activity: aeronautics and space, energy and environment, automotive, services and telecommunications, civil engineering. Reserved for the upstream dimensioning and verification of complex systems until recently, digital simulation has become widespread because it saves significant time on the design and production cycles of more elementary new products. Very often the design of an object or a system responding to general specifications is formalized as a constrained optimization problem. Modeling and scientific computing are therefore very often used in combination with optimization methods
