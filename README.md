### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# **Machine Learning - Deep Learning Projects**

##  <ul> **Advanced projects** </ul>

This section contains Research and Development projects in Machine Learning and Deep Learning that require original developments. They call on our expertise in Digital Signal* Processing, Optimization, Linear Algebra. <br>
This section is under continuous development as research progresses. <br> 

*Signals are not restricted to audio. <br>
They can be any type. A good example is the application with genome classification.
 



##  <ul> **Standard projects** </ul>

This section is a portfolio of Machine Learning projects programmed with Python and various visualization and analysis modules. Most of these projects were carried out within the framework of IBM certifications. They are presented with Jupyter Notebooks. <br>
  Some projects have been improved by incorporating more in-depth data analysis. Before the application of Machine Learning algorithms.
