## **Machine Learning - Deep Learning Projects**

###  <ul> **Advanced projects** </ul>


This section contains Research and Development projects in Machine Learning and Deep Learning that require original developments. They call on our expertise in Digital Signal Processing, Optimization, Calculus, Linear Algebra. <br>

- #### <ul>[Machine Learning and Digital Signal Processing for Genome Classification](https://github.com/DrStef/Machine-Learning-and-Digital-Signal-Processing-for-Genome-Classification/blob/main/README.md) </ul>
<ul><ul> Project based on journal article: <i>"ML-DSP: Machine Learning with Digital Signal Processing for ultrafast, accurate, and scalable genome classification at all taxonomic levels."</i>, Gurjit S. Randhawa, Kathleen A. Hill and Lila Kari. BMC Genomics (2019) 20:267. https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-5571-y <br>    
We improve classification accuracy on their challenging "Fungi" dataset. </ul></ul>

###  <ul> **Standard projects** </ul>

This section is a portfolio of Machine Learning projects with Python and various visualization and analysis tools. Most of these projects were carried out within the framework of IBM certifications. They are presented with Jupyter Notebooks. <br>
  Some projects have been improved by incorporating more in-depth data analysis, better graphs, advanced ML techniques. 

- #### <ul> [**Machine Learning with Python**](https://github.com/DrStef/Machine_Learning_with_Python-IBM/blob/main/README.md)
<ul><ul> A widerange of small projects with various ML techniques, prediction, supervised and unsupervised classification: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Non-Linear Regression, Recommandation Systems, KNN, Customer Segmentation with K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Density-Based Clustering, Logistic Regression. </ul></ul>
  
- #### <ul> [SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction](https://github.com/DrStef/Applied_Data_Science_Capstone_SpaceX_IBM/blob/main/README.md) </ul>      
  
<ul><ul> In this project, we predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. Project includes: SpaceX data collection, Data Wrangling, Webscraping,  EDA with SQL Queries & Data visualization, SpaceX Launch Records Dashboard, Launch Sites Locations Analysis with Folium, Machine Learning classification with optimization of hyperparameters and selection of best model: KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression. </ul></ul>
  
- #### <ul> [House sales in King County USA](https://github.com/DrStef/House_Sales_in_King_County_USA_IBM/blob/main/README.md) </ul>    
<ul><ul> The project consists of finding the best model for predicting home prices in King County, USA in Washington State, based on a dataset of homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Prediction accuracy was improved by implementing a spline regression model.<br>  One Jupyter Notebook includes interactive Folium maps (interactive maps will not display on Github). </ul></ul>

- #### <ul> [Loan status prediction using Classification Algorithms](https://github.com/DrStef/Loan-Status-Prediction-using-Classification-Algorithms_IBM/blob/main/README.md)</ul> 
  
  <ul>Loan Status Prediction using Supervised Classification Algorithms: KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression.</ul>
