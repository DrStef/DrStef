Automatic Environmental Sound Classification (ESC) leverages the ESC-50 dataset (and its ESC-10 subset) developed by Karol Piczak, as detailed in his paper titled: 
<b><i> "ESC: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification." </i></b> by Karol J. Piczak. 2015. In Proceedings of the 23rd ACM international conference on Multimedia (MM '15). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 1015–1018. https://doi.org/10.1145/2733373.2806390"

This dataset serves as a foundation for research in audio event recognition. 

Advancements in ESC Using Multi-Feature CNNs:

We propose a two-stages classification approach with Multi-feature Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), achieving near-perfect accuracy rates, specifically reaching up to 99%. This high accuracy is attributed to innovative pre-processing techniques that combine mel-spectrograms with complex wavelet transforms (CWT).

Resolution of Remaining Classification Challenges:

A notable challenge in ESC-10 sound classification was the confusion between "sea waves" and "rain" sounds. This issue was addressed by developing an original transformation of the complex CWT, termed <i>aT-CWT</i>. This transformation replaces the phase component of the CWT for stationary and pseudo-stationary sounds with a Gaussian distribution, enhancing the model's ability to differentiate between similar sounding environmental events. <br>
By integrating the <i>aT-CWT</i> transformation, the multi-feature CNN model has now achieved 100% accuracy in classifying environmental sounds from the ESC-10 dataset.

- #### <ul>[Unsupervised Valve Fault Detection](https://github.com/DrStef/MIMII/blob/main/README.md)</ul>

<ul><ul>
This project develops an automatic unsupervised classification model to diagnose valve faults in industrial machinery using acoustic signals from an 8-microphone circular array, leveraging the MIMII dataset (CC BY-SA 4.0, Hitachi, Ltd., https://zenodo.org/records/3384388). <br> 
 We introduced a novel ACSTFT transform, achieving an impressive ROC AUC of 0.99 on the +6dB valve dataset, and trained a CNN-Autoencoder for robust anomaly detection. <br>
Unlike standard MIMII challenge approaches that classify noisy signals directly, we prioritize denoising using MVDR beamforming combined with a custom Generalized Sidelobe Canceler (GSC), transforming the array into a noise-robust “sensor.” <br>
Focused exclusively on valves, this model enhances fault detection in challenging industrial environments, offering a practical solution for machinery monitoring. Explore the code, ROC curves, and spectrograms showcasing our results.

In this project, we are developing effective methods for classifying mitochondrial genomes (DNA sequences) using Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). This research is ongoing, and we plan to publish our results regularly. As a starting point, we analyzed the paper titled: <br>
 <i><b> "ML-DSP: Machine Learning with Digital Signal Processing for ultrafast, accurate, and scalable genome classification at all taxonomic levels" </b></i> by Gurjit S. Randhawa , Kathleen A. Hill and Lila Kari. https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5571-y
<br><br>
The alignment-free DNA sequence classification approach: <i>ML-DSP</i>, proposed by Gurjit S. Randhawa has proven to be very effective. <br>  By introducing a simple alignment technique alongside short Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), termed <i>ML-FFT + SoftAlign</i>, we have surpassed the performance of <i>ML-DSP</i>, particularly with challenging datasets such as those from Fungi and Insects.

Modeling is the process that formalizes a concrete problem in mathematical terms accessible to analysis and numerical calculation.

Scientific computing is the interdisciplinary field that brings together the methods and algorithms for performing, using computers, numerical simulations based on a scientific approach. Most models involve equations (differential or partial derivatives) too complicated to be solved by elementary methods or using computer algebra techniques. Scientific computing proposes to give approximate numerical solutions to these models. The development of scientific computing is linked to the regular increase in the power of computers. It is therefore a constantly evolving sector.

Companies that use and develop modeling and scientific computing range from large state-owned or private companies responsible for designing and developing complex systems to small companies or start-ups specializing in software development. They operate in all sectors of activity: aeronautics and space, energy and environment, automotive, services and telecommunications, civil engineering. Reserved for the upstream dimensioning and verification of complex systems until recently, digital simulation has become widespread because it saves significant time on the design and production cycles of more elementary new products. Very often the design of an object or a system responding to general specifications is formalized as a constrained optimization problem. Modeling and scientific computing are therefore very often used in combination with optimization methods
